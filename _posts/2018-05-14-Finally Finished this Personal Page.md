title: Finally Finished this Personal Page

**I finally finished this personal website!** The reason that I used "finally", because I started building it six months ago, which is a super long time to build a static website. Especially, this website don't have much (or any) design or interaction at all.

Of course I am not constantly working on, which is one of the main reasons for this long time. However, the biggest problem is I always want to do works perfectly befor I lauch or publish them. 

Perfection is good and important for academic research in my opinion, but not all stuffs need to be perfect and not all the imperfection is wrong. For example, the imperfection could be limitation in a paper, and a poor design figure is acceptable if it can convey the correct message to readers. What I want to say is that don't let those imperfection prevent you from publishing your research, posting a post or lauching your personal page.

How to distingush what imperfection is acceptable and what is not is truly an ability that need to acultivate from practile experience and the experience when you screw up. I expect I can become a perfectionist who remember Incrementalism in mind.

*Definitly improve this website and my english writing, but I'm happy I finished my personal web and published my first post on it today! yeeeeee*
