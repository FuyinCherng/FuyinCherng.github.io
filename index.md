# Hello!
I'm Fu-Yin Cherng (程芙茵). I'm currently an adjunct assistant professor in the Department of Information Management at the National Taiwan University. I also conducted my postdoctoral research with [Prof. Bing-Yu Chen](http://graphics.im.ntu.edu.tw/~robin/). I design interdisciplinary research plans (e.g., human-computer interaction, data science, and sensing of physiological data) for evaluating users’ behaviors and perceptions qualitatively and quantitatively to the industrial and academic collaborators. My research interests include Human-Computer Interaction, Brain-Computer Interface, Neuroergonomics, Learning Analytics, and Data-Driven Design.


I started working with [Prof. Hao-Chuan Wang](http://www.haochuanwang.info/) at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) as a postdoctoral researcher during 2019 to 2020. I was a doctoral research assistant in the [CHILI Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/chili/) at [École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/home/) from 2016 to 2017. During 2013 to 2019, I was a research assistant and PhD Candidate in the [Graphics and Perception Labs](https://gpl.cs.nctu.edu.tw) lead by [Prof Wen-Chieh Lin](https://gpl.cs.nctu.edu.tw/Steve-Lin/) at [NCTU](https://www.nctu.edu.tw/).

# Research Projects
## Social Preference Effect in E-Commerce Context
![project_vreeg](assets/img/Pro_vreeg.png)
_2019 - Present, UC Davis, [CSC Lab](http://www.haochuanwang.info/) and [Looxid Labs](https://looxidlabs.com/mobile-home/)_

We studied users' internal and external preference and effects of social conformity. Through self-report and biometric measures, we derived design implications for supporting users' decision-making process.

## Large-scale Online Studies for Graphic and Audio Icons
![project_vreeg](assets/img/Pro_LargeScale.png)
_2017 - 2019, National Chiao Tung University, [Graphics and Perception Lab](https://gpl.cs.nctu.edu.tw)_

We collected and curated massive data with over 2k online workers rated 10k icons and achieved accuracy of 85% on predicting users' feedback using CNN models. The feature space of icons with different functions was constructed using Siamese network. Moreover, we studied effects of demographics, experience, and contexts on feedback to icons.

## Brain Sensing Techniques on Evaluating Design and Usability
![project_vreeg](assets/img/Pro_EEGIcon.png)
_2014 - 2018, National Chiao Tung University, [Graphics and Perception Lab](https://gpl.cs.nctu.edu.tw)_

We collected users' brain signals (i.e., Electroencephalography, short for EEG) and applied Matlab toolboxes to process brain signals for offline and online analysis.
We not only uncovered the underlying cognitive states to complement the results of behavioral and self-report evaluation, but also delivered design suggestions which based on cognitive evidences.

## Time-anchored Peer Comments in Online Learning
![project_vreeg](assets/img/Pro_Taping.png)
_2015 - 2017, National Chiao Tung University, [Graphics and Perception Lab](https://gpl.cs.nctu.edu.tw)_

We designed an online learning website with an interactive commenting system and prototyped interface to visualize comments with topic and sentiment analysis. Usability testing and factorial experiment with learners and instructors was conducted to evaluate the effect and desired benefits of our systems. We reported the evaluation result in both qualitatively and quantitatively fashions.

## Detect Hidden Training Needs Using Job Advertisements
![project_vreeg](assets/img/Pro_TraningNeeds.png)
_2017, EPFL, [Computer-Human Interaction in Learning and Instruction Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/chili/)_

In this project, we analyzed job titles and skills from 600k job ads to understand the changes in requirement of different technical skills.
Hence, we developed framework to scrap and aggregate job ads (e.g., normalizing job titles from different job ads) from multiple job boards and conducted cross dataset analysis between job ads and Google Trends.

## Finding Question Topics in MOOCs Forum by Using Stack Exchange
![project_vreeg](assets/img/Pro_Tags.png)
_2016, EPFL, [Computer-Human Interaction in Learning and Instruction Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/chili/)_

We want to detect the topics of questions that are asked most frequently in the discussion forum of Coursera, so we want to use the user-generated tags of the posts in StackExchange to automatically predict the tags of the questions in Coursera.
We first measured divergence of word distributions between the two platforms using cross-entropy, and KL and JS divergence, and L1 and L2 distance. We achieved mean accuracy of 88% on predicting tags for online posts.
